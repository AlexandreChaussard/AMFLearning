class MondrianTree(ABC):
    """
    Base class for Mondrian Trees.

    This is an **abstract class**, so it cannot be used directly. It defines base operations
    and properties that all the Mondrian Trees must inherit or implement according to
    their own design.

    Parameters
    ----------
        n_features: int,
            Number of features
        step: float,
            Step parameter of the tree
        loss: str
            Set to "log" for classifiers
        use_aggregation: bool,
            Should it use aggregation
        split_pure: bool,
            Should the tree split pure leafs when training
        iteration: int,
            Number of iterations to run when training

    Attributes
    ----------
        intensities: list[float]
            List of intensity per feature
        tree: MondrianTreeBranch or None
            Base branch of the tree (starting root)
