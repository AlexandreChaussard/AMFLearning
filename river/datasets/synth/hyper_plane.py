class Hyperplane(datasets.base.SyntheticDataset):
    r"""Hyperplane stream generator.

    Generates a problem of prediction class of a rotation hyperplane. It was
    used as testbed for CVFDT and VFDT in [^1].

    A hyperplane in d-dimensional space is the set of points $x$ that satisfy

    $$\sum^{d}_{i=1} w_i x_i = w_0 = \sum^{d}_{i=1} w_i$$

    where $x_i$ is the i-th coordinate of $x$.

    - Examples for which $\sum^{d}_{i=1} w_i x_i > w_0$, are labeled positive.

    - Examples for which $\sum^{d}_{i=1} w_i x_i \leq w_0$, are labeled negative.

    Hyperplanes are useful for simulating time-changing concepts because we
    can change the orientation and position of the hyperplane in a smooth
    manner by changing the relative size of the weights. We introduce change
    to this dataset by adding drift to each weighted feature
    $w_i = w_i + d \sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the probability that the
    direction of change is reversed and $d$ is the change applied to each
    example.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed
        If int, `seed` is used to seed the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, `seed` is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the `RandomState` instance used
        by `np.random`.
    n_features
        The number of attributes to generate. Higher than 2.
    n_drift_features
        The number of attributes with drift. Higher than 2.
    mag_change
        Magnitude of the change for every example. From 0.0 to 1.0.
    noise_percentage
        Percentage of noise to add to the data. From 0.0 to 1.0.
    sigma
        Probability that the direction of change is reversed. From 0.0 to 1.0.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from river.datasets import synth

    >>> dataset = synth.Hyperplane(seed=42, n_features=2)

    >>> for x, y in dataset.take(5):
    ...     print(x, y)
    {0: 0.7319, 1: 0.5986} 1
    {0: 0.8661, 1: 0.6011} 1
    {0: 0.8324, 1: 0.2123} 0
    {0: 0.5247, 1: 0.4319} 0
    {0: 0.2921, 1: 0.3663} 0

    Notes
    -----
    The sample generation works as follows: The features are generated
    with the random number generator, initialized with the seed passed by
    the user. Then the classification function decides, as a function of
    the sum of the weighted features and the sum of the weights, whether
    the instance belongs to class 0 or class 1. The last step is to add
    noise and generate drift.
