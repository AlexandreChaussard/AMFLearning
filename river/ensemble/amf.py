    n_estimators

         Step-size for the aggregation weights.
    loss
        The loss used for the computation of the aggregation weights.
    use_aggregation
        Controls if aggregation is used in the trees. It is highly recommended to

    split_pure
        Controls if nodes that contains only sample of the same class should be

class AMFClassifier(AMFLearner, Classifier):
    """
    Aggregated Mondrian Forest classifier for online learning. This algorithm
    is truly online, in the sense that a single pass is performed, and that predictions
    can be produced anytime.

    Each node in a tree predicts according to the distribution of the labels
    it contains. This distribution is regularized using a "Jeffreys" prior
    with parameter `dirichlet`. For each class with `count` labels in the
    node and `n_samples` samples in it, the prediction of a node is given by

        $\frac{count + dirichlet}{n_{samples} + dirichlet \times n_{classes}}$

    The prediction for a sample is computed as the aggregated predictions of all the
    subtrees along the path leading to the leaf node containing the sample. The
    aggregation weights are exponential weights with learning rate `step` and log-loss
    when `use_aggregation` is `True`.

    This computation is performed exactly thanks to a context tree weighting algorithm.
    More details can be found in the paper cited in references below.

    The final predictions are the average class probabilities predicted by each of the
    ``n_estimators`` trees in the forest.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_classes
        Number of expected classes in the labels. This is required since we
        don't know the number of classes in advance in a online setting.
    n_estimators
        The number of trees in the forest.
    step
        Step-size for the aggregation weights. Default is 1 for classification with
        the log-loss, which is usually the best choice.
    use_aggregation
        Controls if aggregation is used in the trees. It is highly recommended to
        leave it as `True`.
    dirichlet
        Regularization level of the class frequencies used for predictions in each
        node. Default is dirichlet=0.5 for n_classes=2 and dirichlet=0.01 otherwise.
    split_pure
        Controls if nodes that contains only sample of the same class should be
        split ("pure" nodes). Default is `False`, namely pure nodes are not split,
        but `True` can be sometimes better.
    seed
        Random seed for reproducibility

    Note
    ----
    Only log_loss used for the computation of the aggregation weights is supported for now, namely the log-loss
    for multi-class classification.
